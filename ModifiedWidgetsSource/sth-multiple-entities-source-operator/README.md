# STH source operator

The STH source operator is a WireCloud operator that allows you to retrieve
historical information about context broker entities through the use of the
[Short Time Historic](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet)
(Comet) component.

Latest version of this operator is always [provided in FIWARE
Lab](https://store.lab.fiware.org/search/keyword/OrionStarterKit) where you
can make use of it on the [Mashup portal](https://mashup.lab.fiware.org).
Remember to take a look into the example mashups provided in the OrionStarterKit offering.

## Build

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](http://node.js). For example, you can install it on Ubuntu and Debian running the following commands:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
```

Install other npm dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

For build the widget you need download grunt:

```bash
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

And now, you can use grunt:

```bash
grunt
```

If everything goes well, you will find a wgt file in the `dist` folder.
