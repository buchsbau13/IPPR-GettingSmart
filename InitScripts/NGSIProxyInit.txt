The ngsi-proxy is started with the rest of the infrastructure using the docker-compose file.

For using the NGSI proxy locally when using the Docker infrastructure:
1) Find out Docker host IP (Default interface: "docker0" on Linux, "vEthernet (Standardswitch)" on Windows)
2) In Wirecloud, use "http://<docker-host-ip>/3000" as URl for the NGSI proxy. On Linux, additional firewall configurations might be necessary.
